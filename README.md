# About

SecLists is a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data grep strings, fuzzing payloads, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repo onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.

This project is maintained by [Daniel Miessler](http://www.danielmiessler.com/ "Daniel Miessler") and [Jason Haddix](http://www.securityaegis.com "Jason Haddix"). 

## Contributing

If you have any ideas for things we should include, please use one of the following methods to submit them:

1. Fork the project and send us pull requests
2. Send us links through this project, and we'll go and parse them and incorporate them
3. Email daniel.miessler@owasp.org or jason.haddix@owasp.org with content to add

Most anyone submitting content to the repo will get their name added to the credits, but keep in mind that any lists that have been meticulously assembled by someone else will only be used with permission of the creator. ]
